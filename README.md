# Web Application Dashboard

On this project I created fully responosive web application dashboard for social media using vanilla JavaScript,  Sass and svg animations.
Here are some major features:
1. I also used external Chart.js to create the graphs.
2. The chart presents dynamic statistics. 
3. The settings are stored in the localStorage memory.
4. The form present an autocomplete of the users. 
5. A notification bar is shown on the account menu.
