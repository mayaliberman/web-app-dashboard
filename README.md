# Web Application Dashboard

On this project, I created a fully responsive web application dashboard for social media using vanilla JavaScript, Sass, and SVG animations. Here are some major features:

1. I used external Chart.js to create the graphs.
2. The chart presents a dynamic statistics.
3. The settings are stored in the localStorage memory.
4. The form presents an autocomplete of the users.
5. A notification bar is shown on the account menu.
